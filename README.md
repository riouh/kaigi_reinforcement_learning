# Reinforcement learning introduction

This repo proposes a small UI to train an test Q-Learning agents on a simple game.
The UI is made with Svelte and Typescript. The Q-learning algorithm runs in a nodeJS server and the communication 
with the UI is made via Websocket to give a real-time sensation to the user during the learning phase.
